## Contributing to ReProvision

Hey there! Thanks for being interested in contributing to this project.

The Pull Request process is very loose, with a typical set of steps looking like:

- Make sure a ticket exists in the main repository that covers the scope of your Pull Request (creating it if necessary)
- Associated tickets should be referenced in commit messages where practical
- Before submitting the request, you must test your changes on a real device
- Update README.md if necessary
